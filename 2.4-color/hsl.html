    <h1>CSS HSL Colors</h1>
    <p>In CSS, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
        <br> Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
        <br> Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
        <br> Lightness is also a percentage. 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white
