    <h1>CSS HEX Colors</h1>
    <p>
        In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form: #rrggbb
        <br> Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
        <br> For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).
        <br> To display black, set all values to 00, like this: #000000.
        <br> To display white, set all values to ff, like this: #ffffff.
    </p>
    <h1> Digit HEX Value</h1>
    <p id="para">
        Sometimes you will see a 3-digit hex code in the CSS source.
        <br> The 3-digit hex code is a shorthand for some 6-digit hex codes.
        <br> The 3-digit hex code has the following form: #rgb
        <br> Where r, g, and b represent the red, green, and blue components with values between 0 and f.
        <br> The 3-digit hex code can only be used when both the values (RR, GG, and BB) are the same for each component. So, if we have #ff00cc, it can be written like this: #f0c.</p>
