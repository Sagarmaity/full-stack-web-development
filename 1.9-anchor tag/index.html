    <h2>HTML Links - Hyperlinks</h2>
    <p>HTML links are hyperlinks. <br> You can click on a link and jump to another document. <br> When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.</p>

    <h2>HTML Links - Syntax</h2>
    <p>The HTML anchor tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:</p>
    <a href="url">link text</a>
    <p>The most important attribute of the anchor element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader. Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.</p>

    <h2>HTML Links - The target Attribute</h2>

    <pre>By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

        The <mark>target</mark> attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
        
        The  <mark>target</mark> attribute can have one of the following values:
        
        _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
        _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
        _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
        _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window</pre>


    <h2>Link to an Email Address</h2>
    <p>Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):</p>
    <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>
    <a href="./index2.html">next page</a>
